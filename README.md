# In Control

Sean is a sales team lead who has a team of growing SDRs under him. He is tasked to make the best business decisions about his team and know how hiring is affecting his process. He goes into SFDC dashboards everyday to view his charts, not his email, and "just eyeballs" whether things are going right or not. Now, he can get the charts to his email letting him know if his sales processes are out of control or not.

Originally developed at Salesforce Hackathon, this app allows for the tracking of SFDC metrics using control charts. Receive daily updates with charts in your emails alerting you to out of control processes.

Featuring one click deploy to Heroku. You will need several environmental variables which will be outlined in the process. You also need to configure your SFDC application to have the correct callback url.
